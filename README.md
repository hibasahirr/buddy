A productivity-focused hydration tracker designed for 8-hour workdays. To build consistent habits, the app features 7 daily levels, each with two stages. Users must upload a real-time photo of themselves drinking water to silence the scheduled alarms, ensuring accountability through "proof of hydration" before moving to the next level.
